//! ðŸ›  Personal Budget Tracker Challenge (Phase 4 - Arithmetic operators)
/*
ðŸ“Œ Challenge Requirements:

- Calculate total expenses by summing multiple expenses such as rent, groceries, transport, entertainment.
- Apply tax deduction (e.g., 10% of income).
- Calculate savings percentage (e.g., 20% of remaining balance).
